## Tony Rapoza

My name is Anthony Rapoza and I am graduating with a bachelor’s degree in Computer Science from Southern New Hampshire University. As a child I always dabbled in programming and game development, but it wasn’t until 2018 that I decided to dedicate myself to programming and enrolled in Southern New Hampshire’s Computer Science Program. It was through this program that I was able to gain confidence and in-depth knowledge of how to use programming to solve issues I ran into, automate tasks to save time, and create programs, applications, and video games from scratch. I am always filled with joy looking back at how far I have come since beginning my formal studies.

Below you will find an artifact that I created back when I first began my programming journey. It was a simple, full-stack task management application for android that I built in an introductory mobile development class. As you will see from the code review, while I had a solid understanding of programming concepts, there was so much more I had to learn to make this application achieve its potential. I chose to showcase this artifact as the enhancements I have recently made to it show how much I have learned and grown throughout this program as a full-stack developer. As you browse through the enhancements made to this project, I hope to show you specifically what I am capable of as a programmer now.

In the first enhancement you will see that I have successfully ported my original project from Android Studio and Java to Unity Engine using C#. This shows not only my ability to understand and learn new languages and frameworks, but also my ability to transfer and implement logic between them successfully. As you read through my narrative, I hope you can gain an understanding of the considerations and thinking behind why I felt this port would be a beneficial enhancement to the program.

In the second enhancement you will see my ability to streamline, expand, organize, and secure existing programs to better suit the environment and use cases they are tailored for. When further developing this artifact, I decided to completely overhaul the existing structure of the code while still retaining some of the original logical processes. The original application was based solely around tying together Androids UI elements to the SQLite backend. You will see that I cleared up vulnerabilities and streamlined the entire applications back-end operations by building all of the scripts around a custom-built script-based database system I developed specifically for this application. Furthermore, I was able to make the code run far more efficiently by building a more robust system of functions that handle related processes without being hampered by many of the technical drawbacks presented by the original Android Studio framework.

Finally, in my third enhancement to this artifact, I will be converting the project over to the previously mentioned database system that I built. This shows not only my ability to completely build a back-end system from scratch, but also my ability to structure it in a way that is re-usable, efficient, and customizable to the program I have built. I also hope my narrative will convey to you my thought process behind why I decided to migrate to a custom system from the original SQLite system.

Throughout this portfolio, I have made an effort to showcase my desire and ability to maximize efficiency and work smarter, not harder. I value re-usability, readability, and customizability above all else when programming as most of the time other people will be collaborating with me and these attributes make collaboration and teamwork run smoothly.

Thank you for taking the time to read about me and my approach to programming.
